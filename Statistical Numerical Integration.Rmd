Suppose you have a random variable 𝑋 taking values in ℝ and with density 𝑓(⋅), and that you want to calculate the expectation of some function 𝑔(𝑋). Assuming that this expectation exists, it is defined as 𝔼[𝑔(𝑋))]=∫∞−∞𝑔(𝑥)𝑓(𝑥)𝑑x. If the integral can't be done analytically then you might consider using numerical methods to evaluate it. The trapezium rule, encountered in the Week 3 self-study materials, is one such method. However, it can only be used for integrals over a finite range: the range of integration here is infinite.

A potential solution to this problem is to transform the variable of integration. Specifically, consider the transformation 𝑢=𝐹(𝑥) where 𝐹(⋅) is the cumulative distribution function of x. Then𝑢ranges from 0 and 1; we have 𝑥=𝐹−1(𝑢) and 𝑑𝑢=𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥. Hence the required integral can be rewritten as

𝔼[𝑔(𝑋)]=∫∞−∞𝑔(𝑥)𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥=∫1𝑢=0𝑔[𝐹−1(𝑢))]𝑑𝑢 .

The range of integration (0,1) is now finite and can be divided into n intervals of length n-1, so that the trapezium rule gives the approximation

𝔼[𝑔(𝑋)]=∫1𝑢=0𝑔[𝐹−1(𝑢))]𝑑𝑢≈12𝑛{𝑔[𝐹−1(0)]+2𝑔[𝐹−1(1𝑛)]+…+2𝑔[𝐹−1(𝑛−1𝑛)]+𝑔[𝐹−1(1)]}.

The terms 𝐹−1(𝑢), 𝐹−1(1) inside the integral is not finite. They will be removed from the calculation and the justification of doing so is that in the limit as 𝑛→∞, the omitted terms will cover a vanishingly small proportion of the interval (0,1) so that their contribution to the integral will decrease to zero given that the expectation is known.

Hence, the final approximation:
E[g(x)] = 1/2𝑛*{𝑔[𝐹−1(1𝑛)]+2𝑔[𝐹−1(2𝑛)]+…+2𝑔[𝐹−1(𝑛−2𝑛)]+𝑔[𝐹−1(𝑛−1𝑛)]}

```{r}

polyexpect<-function(mu=0, sigsq=1, a, n=100){
  
  #Nested function to evaluate the polynomial value of x
  polynomial_function<-function(x){
    
    polynomial_value_x<-sum(a*x^(0:(length(a) - 1)))
    
    return(polynomial_value_x)
  }
  
  #transformation of u=F(x)
  u_value<- seq(1/n,(n-1)/n, length.out = n-1)
  
  x_value<- qnorm(u_value, mean = mu, sd=sqrt(sigsq))
  
  #calculating the corresponding value of the polynomial
  gx_value <- vector("numeric", length = length(x_value))

  for (i in 1:length(x_value)) {
    gx_value[i] <- polynomial_function(x_value[i])
  }
  
  #calculation of the expectation E[g(X)]
  trapezium_areas<-gx_value[1]+gx_value[length(gx_value)]+2*sum(gx_value[2:length(gx_value)-1])
  expectation<-(1/(2*n))*trapezium_areas
  
  #returning results as required
  return(list(expectation, x_value, gx_value))
}
```
